# img2html
Converts raster graphics images to HTML/CSS.

To launch it, simply execute the script in a terminal and hand it the path to the desired imaged when asked to do so.
Size of "pixels" is hardcoded at the moment, will be prompted in a later version.

## dependencies
- Pyhton 2 (tested on Python 2.7.12)
- you'll need to install the imaging library (see https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/2.2.1)

## current constraints
- will not read images with an alpha channel
- will not run on python 3
